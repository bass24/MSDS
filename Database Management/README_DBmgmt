# File Organization and Database Management

File Organization and Database Management was a course that focused on how to design a database schema properly in relational databases (MySQL was used), utlize normalization, and run efficient queries. Weekly assignments included running SQL queries on self created relational databases. Queries would include inserting and deleting data, using joins on foreign keys link multiple tables, and using group by and having to limit queries to specific questions. I will not be posting those assignments to here as other students will likely have very similar if not the same assignments.

Mini projects included providing data results from SQL and NoSQL (ArangoDB) as ReST end-points using Python and Postman. Libraries used included MySQLdb, Flask, pyArango, arango, and flask_arangodb. Queries were run on a previously provided database to provide information on a hypothetical companies sales.

We were also introduced to multiple schemaless NoSQL databases; ArangoDB, MongoDB, and Neo4j. For our final project our team (Nicole Wittlin and myself) created a walkthrough of how a nonprofit (From the Top) could utilize MongoDB Compass in conjunction with MongoDB Compass, and Amazon Web Services (AWS S3, and IAM namely) to upload, store, and manage their sensitive data. Data included multimedia, financial, and data involving minors. Our walkthrough included having password protected logins for different departments who would only need access to certain aspects of the data (ex. financial department only needing billing information), whitelisted IP addresses, multi-factor authentication, and encrypting the database using AES256-CBC (Advanced Encryption Standard symmetric-key cipher in Cipher Block Chaining mode) with scheduled rotation of encryption keys. Encryption in transit was provided by default using TLS/SSL cryptographic protocols.
